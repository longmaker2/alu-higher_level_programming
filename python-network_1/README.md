All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)

All your files should end with a new line

The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3

A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory

Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7)

All your files must be executable

The length of your files will be tested using wc

All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')

You must use get to access to dictionary value by key (it won’t throw an exception if the key doesn’t exist in the dictionary)

A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)

Your code should not be executed when imported (by using if __name__ == "__main__":)
